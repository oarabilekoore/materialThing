# materialThing

materialThing is a lightweight, pure JavaScript UI library and framework that lets you build interactive interfaces without touching the DOM directly. 

It hides low-level document.createElement calls behind clean, declarative APIs—making UI creation as simple as writing JavaScript functions. With built-in component structure, state management, and styling defaults, materialThing gives you both the flexibility of vanilla JS and the power of a modern framework.
