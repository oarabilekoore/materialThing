# materialThing Headless UI

! NOTE :::: 
Current development on this package is stopped but will continue soon.


This package provides a set of headless UI components that can be used to build custom UIs without the need for any styling or layout.
They are built using core format instead of the .mtx JSX Language Extension Formart. This is to allow everyone to use the components
without involving an extra build step.
